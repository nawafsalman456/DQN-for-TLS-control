assume we have 6 traffic light states : [0,5]

assume we need to keep traffic lights order between states (is this right ?):
0->1->2->3->4->5->0->1->...

start with a very simple algorithm:
for every state we can do one of 2 actions:
1- stay in current state
2- go to next state

for example, if we use A* with heuristic function h, and distance function g. (f = g + h)
we have this simple graph : 0->1->2->3->4->5->0
from state i, choose to go to state with the minimal f value:
i : if f(i) < f(i+1)
i+1 : if f(i+1) < f(i)
Note: here g and h are not defined on the above simple graph, they are defined on infinite graph where every state is a pair of (tl_state, timestamp):
(0,0)->(1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,4)->...



PLAN:
1- write different algorithms and test them, add a testing environment, test all algorithms and verify that we don't have collisions or bad_performance(for now, verify not worse that random algorithm).
2- build a GIT repo, give access to Nahel and Ayal. add code review ability, and gate keeper (if simple). (repo should include a README on how to set the env)
3- learn RL, think how to solve the problem using RL. are the above ideas relevant also here ?
