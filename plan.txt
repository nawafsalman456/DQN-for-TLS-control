assume we have 6 traffic light states : [0,5]

assume we need to keep traffic lights order between states (is this right ?):
0->1->2->3->4->5->0->1->...
(may be a big limitation, need to try the algorithms without this assumption).

start with a very simple algorithm:
for every state we can do one of 2 actions:
1- stay in current state
2- go to next state

for example, if we use A* with heuristic function h, and distance function g. (f = g + h)
we have this simple graph : 0->1->2->3->4->5->0
from state i, choose to go to state with the minimal f value:
i : if f(i) < f(i+1)
i+1 : if f(i+1) < f(i)
Note: here g and h are not defined on the above simple graph, they are defined on infinite graph where every state is a pair of (tl_state, timestamp):
(0,0)->(1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,4)->...


Q-Learning simple algorithm:
NN:
input: s - vector of (num of waiting vehicles, num of slowing vehicles, num of waiting people, total waiting time, num of buses, and other observations ....)
2-3 hidden layers, each of size 32x32 or 64x64.
output: vector of Q, size = 2:
    Q(s, stay_in_curr_state)
    Q(s, go_to_next_state)
Reward of state s: (minus of) the average time people/vehicles exist in the simulation.
given a state s, pass it through the NN, and pick the action with maximal Q.
Training: use RL to train and calculate the network's parameters.
Later: add GAMMA ? handle noise ? handle unexpected behaviour (add transition probability) ? 

NEXT STEPS:
1- multi-processing : accelerate the optimization + get access to lab GPUs (write this in the report).
2- Hyper-parameters tuning : using cross-validation ? Later, not in this stage of the project. now tune manually.

questions to think about for next stages ? :
1- after training the model, does it work for other junctions ? or do we need to build a different model (different parameters and input vector dimension) for each junction ? and how to train the model in real world for each junction ?
2- build simulations for people flows instead of car flows ? different types of vehicles ?
3- for the training - can we build a simulation generator to build several simulations ? can it simulate "good" tls phases and car/people flows ?
